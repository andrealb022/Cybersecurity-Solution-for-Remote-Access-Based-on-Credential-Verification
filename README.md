This project addresses a cybersecurity challenge by developing a system that enables remote access to services based on valid credentials. Users can obtain credentials from various authorities and use them to access restricted services. The system focuses on ensuring security through confidentiality, integrity, and transparency, while minimizing reliance on trusted third parties. It aims to protect sensitive information and grant access based on credentials such as residency or birth information. The design emphasizes robust security, usability, and protection against large-scale attacks, while ensuring transparency in the system's operations.
